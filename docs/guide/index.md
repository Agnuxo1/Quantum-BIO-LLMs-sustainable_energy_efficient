# Getting Started with Quantum-BIO-LLMs

Quantum-BIO-LLMs is a groundbreaking project that combines quantum computing, bioinspired neural architectures, and holographic memory systems to create a next-generation language model system.

## Overview

The system integrates three core technologies:

1. **Quantum Computing Layer**: Leverages quantum principles for efficient processing
2. **Bioinspired Neural Networks**: Neural architectures inspired by biological systems
3. **Holographic Memory**: Advanced memory system using light-based encoding

## Key Features

- Quantum-enhanced processing
- Bio-inspired neural adaptation
- Holographic memory patterns
- Real-time optimization
- Energy-efficient operation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install quantum-bio-llms

# Initialize the system
import { QuantumBioLLM } from 'quantum-bio-llms'

const system = new QuantumBioLLM({
  quantumBits: 8,
  neuralLayers: 4,
  memoryCapacity: '128GB'
})

// Start processing
await system.initialize()
```

## System Requirements

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- CUDA-capable GPU (for quantum simulations)
- 16GB RAM minimum
- 100GB storage space
